### 3. **Backend with Node.js and MySQL**
The backend will be powered by **Node.js** for handling server-side operations, while **MySQL** will serve as the database.
#### Core Backend Features:
- **REST API**: Use **Express.js** to create an API that communicates with the database for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication (parents, teachers, and admins) using **JWT** to secure access.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Create**: Add new students, teachers, and classes.
  - **Read**: Fetch student profiles, grades, attendance records.
  - **Update**: Edit student information, attendance, grades, and teacher assignments.
  - **Delete**: Remove inactive students or outdated records.
#### Database Design:
- **Students Table**: To store student personal data.
- **Classes Table**: Store class names, subjects, and associated teachers.
- **Grades Table**: Track students' academic performance.
- **Attendance Table**: Capture daily or term-wise attendance.
- **Teachers Table**: Store teacher profiles and class assignments.
### 4. **Database Structure**
```MySql workbench - database, tables and EER diagrams
### 5. **Deployment and Hosting**
- **Hosting**: Use platforms like Heroku or Vercel for deployment. For the database, you can use **ClearDB MySQL** on Heroku.
- **SSL**: Secure the website with HTTPS for data security.
- **User Management**: Admin access will be provided to manage student and teacher information, while students and teachers will have access to their respective data only.
### 6. **Additional Features**
- **Dashboard**: Create an admin dashboard where the school management can track student performance and attendance at a glance.
- **Reports**: Generate PDF reports for students, showing their grades and attendance.
- **Notification System**: Allow parents to receive updates about grades and attendance.

This structure aligns with your vision to revamp the school’s digital presence and make student data management efficient.
