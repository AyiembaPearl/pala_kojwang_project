  - **Create**: Add new students, teachers, and classes.\par
  - **Read**: Fetch student profiles, grades, attendance records.\par
  - **Update**: Edit student information, attendance, grades, and teacher assignments.\par
  - **Delete**: Remove inactive students or outdated records.\par
\b #### Database Design:\b0\par
- **Students Table**: To store student personal data.\par
- **Classes Table**: Store class names, subjects, and associated teachers.\par
- **Grades Table**: Track students' academic performance.\par
- **Attendance Table**: Capture daily or term-wise attendance.\par
- **Teachers Table**: Store teacher profiles and class assignments.\par
\b ### 4. **Database Structure**\b0\par
```sql\par
CREATE TABLE students (\par
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\par
    name VARCHAR(255),\par
    age INT,\par
    gender ENUM('M', 'F'),\par
    address TEXT,\par
    class_id INT,\par
    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes(id)\par
);\par
CREATE TABLE classes (\par
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\par
    class_name VARCHAR(255),\par
    teacher_id INT,\par
    FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id)\par
);\par
CREATE TABLE grades (\par
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\par
    student_id INT,\par
    class_id INT,\par
    grade DECIMAL(4, 2),\par
    term VARCHAR(255),\par
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id),\par
    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes(id)\par
);\par
CREATE TABLE attendance (\par
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\par
    student_id INT,\par
    date DATE,\par
    status ENUM('Present', 'Absent'),\par
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)\par
);\par
CREATE TABLE teachers (\par
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\par
    name VARCHAR(255),\par
    qualification TEXT\par
);\par
```\par
\b ### 5. **Deployment and Hosting**\b0\par
- **Hosting**: Use platforms like Heroku or Vercel for deployment. For the database, you can use **ClearDB MySQL** on Heroku.\par
